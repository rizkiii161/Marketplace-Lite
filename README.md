### ✨ Main Features

* Displays a list of 6 available products
* Lightweight and beginner-friendly design
* Built using only core web technologies (HTML, CSS, PHP)

This project was created as a personal exercise to understand the basics of web development, including layout, styling, and basic server-side scripting with PHP.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML** – for page structure
* **CSS** – for styling
* **PHP** – for basic server-side logic and rendering

### 📌 Notes

This is a beginner project with limited features, created for learning purposes. I plan to improve and expand it as I continue learning web development.
